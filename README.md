# Reductive

After a long search for a mobile "productivity" app that I liked, I decided that I'm just not productive when I'm away from my computer. Eventually I realized that what I really wanted was to not forget things that I thought about when my computer wasn't around. Thus, Reductive was born.

Reductive aims to helps me not forget things like so:

* Text a thought or idea you don't want to forget to Reductive
* Get reminded by Reductive the next time you sign on to Google Talk

That's it.

I loved the idea of Apple's location-based reminders, but found that right as (or often just before) I arrived somewhere was often the worst time to remind me about something, because I was often in the middle of doing something else. For me, opening my computer and signing into Google Talk is a great predictor that I can be interrupted and record whatever thoughts I had but have probably forgotten already.

### Beta, Alpha, Gamma

I just wrote Reductive this morning and there are tons of things that don't work or aren't documented. I'm putting it on GitHub so that I can come back to it later. It's very likely not ready to be used by anyone else.
